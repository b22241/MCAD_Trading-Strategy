# Stock Trading Strategy using MACD

This repository contains a Python implementation of a stock trading strategy based on the **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** indicator. The script is designed to analyze historical stock data, generate buy/sell signals, simulate trading performance, and visualize results.

---

## Features

- **Calculate MACD and Signal Line**: Automatically computes the MACD line, Signal Line, and Histogram from the input stock data.
- **Generate Trading Signals**: Identifies potential buy and sell points based on MACD/Signal Line crossovers.
- **Simulate Trading**: Simulates a trading strategy starting with a fixed capital (e.g., $1000).
- **Performance Analysis**: Calculates final returns and plots a graph showing the portfolio value over time.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots candlestick charts, MACD indicators, and trading signals for better understanding.

## Input Data Format

The script expects historical stock data in CSV format with the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `Date`          | Trading date                     |
| `OPEN `         | Opening price                    |
| `HIGH `         | Highest price during the session |
| `LOW `          | Lowest price during the session  |
| `close `        | Closing price                   |
| `VOLUME `       | Trading volume                  |

Ensure the column names and formats are consistent. Example:

```csv
"Date ","OPEN ","HIGH ","LOW ","close ","VOLUME "
"01-Jan-2025",1545.00,1591.70,1529.70,1545.15,905795
"31-Dec-2024",1580.00,1580.00,1506.35,1537.25,1043931
```

## Usage

1. Place your input CSV file (e.g., `stock_data.csv`) in the project directory.

2. Update the script to use the correct file name:
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python trade.py
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Calculate MACD and Signal Line.
   - Generate buy/sell signals.
   - Simulate trading starting with $1000.
   - Output the portfolio's performance.
   - Save and display graphs of stock prices and indicators.

## Output

- **Portfolio Returns**: Final portfolio value after applying the strategy.
- **Graphs**: Visualizes candlestick chart, MACD line, Signal Line, and buy/sell signals.
- **Logs**: Prints detailed buy/sell signal information to the console.

## Technical Indicators

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Calculated as the difference between a 12-period EMA and a 26-period EMA.
- Used to measure the strength and direction of a trend.

### Signal Line
- A 9-period EMA of the MACD line.
- Acts as a trigger for buy/sell signals.

### Histogram
- Difference between the MACD line and Signal Line.
- Indicates the strength and momentum of the trend.

## Example Result

Here is an example plot generated by the script:

- **Candlestick Chart**: Shows stock prices.
- **MACD and Signal Line**: Displays crossover points for signals.
- **Portfolio Returns**: Plots portfolio growth over time.
